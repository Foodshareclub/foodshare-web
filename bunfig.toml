# Bun configuration for FoodShare
# https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/bunfig

# Bun is used for:
# - Package management (bun install) - 10x faster than npm
# - Dev server (bun --bun next dev) - faster HMR
# - Production server (bun --bun next start) - lower memory
# - Testing (bun test) - native test runner
# - Script execution (bun run) - faster startup
#
# Node is used for:
# - Production builds (npx next build) - React SSR compatibility
