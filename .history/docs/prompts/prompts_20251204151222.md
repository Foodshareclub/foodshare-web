### Layout ✅ COMPLETED

    - ✅ **Phase 1.1 Complete** - Successfully implemented Airbnb navigation pattern
    - ✅ Search is now the HERO element (center position)
    - ✅ Categories moved to sticky bar BELOW search (always visible)
    - ✅ Smart scroll: Top bar hides, category bar stays sticky
    - ✅ GPU-accelerated animations (60-120fps)
    - ✅ WCAG AA accessibility compliant
    - ✅ Mobile-optimized with touch-friendly spacing
    - 📄 See: `docs/PHASE_1_1_LAYOUT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for full details

    **Card Spacing Decision**: Keeping 40px gap for premium aesthetic
    - Premium aesthetic - Items feel curated, not crammed
    - Community focus - Emphasizes sharing over selling
    - Better accessibility - Easier to distinguish cards
    - Brand differentiation - Not a marketplace clone

### Docs

    - Help you organize the documentation structure and update CLAUDE.md accordingly. Let me first check what documentation files are in the root directory and what's already in the docs folder.
        - The root is now clean with only CLAUDE.md and README.md. Now let me update CLAUDE.md to document this new structure.
        - Update CLAUDE.md to reflect the new documentation structure in the docs/ directory.
        - Docs - organize them inside and categorize
        - Use the ReactJS expert to deeply modify and optimize the code base.

### CRM

    - Help me implement admin role functionality to edit any listings through an advanced CRM system. Let me first explore the current codebase to understand the existing structure around posts/listings and any admin functionality.
        - Use the ReactJS expert to deeply modify and optimize the code base.
        - We use admin "role jsonb not null default '{"admin": false, "volunteer": false, "subscriber": true, "organization": false, "fridge-coordinator": false, "foodbank-coordinator": false}'::jsonb" in the profiles to be able to adit

### Code-base

    - Deeply optimize and modify the existing code-base:
        - Improve Supabase auth
        - Improve the code-base structure
        - Get rid of the redundant files but be extra careful
        - Use the latest best practices for the layout, ui/ux etc
        - Use the neutral naming on the files and folders to avoid issues (proper branding)
        - Take a look at this document for the best practices on the code-base docs/context/ultrathink.md
        - Update the all packages respectively
        - MCP Foodshare if needed

### Search ✅ COMPLETED

    - ✅ **Phase 1.2 Complete** - Enhanced search system fully implemented
    - ✅ Real-time suggestions from database (Supabase full-text search)
    - ✅ Search history with localStorage (last 10 searches)
    - ✅ Popular searches by category (8 per category)
    - ✅ Debounced input (300ms) - reduces API calls by 80%
    - ✅ Full keyboard navigation (Arrow keys, Enter, Escape)
    - ✅ Request cancellation prevents race conditions
    - ✅ Smart caching reduces server load
    - ✅ "No results" state with helpful suggestions
    - ✅ Category-aware filtering
    - ✅ Enhanced SearchBar component with dropdown UI
    - ✅ Loading indicators and smooth animations
    - 📄 See: `docs/PHASE_1_2_SEARCH_ENHANCEMENT.md` for full details

### Skills

    - Analyze the codebase to determine which skills would be most useful for your FoodShare project, then add them.

### Migration

    - Use the react-specialist agent to plan and execute a full migration from Chakra UI to Tailwind + shadcn/ui:
        - Ultrathink it
        - Migrate Core Layout (Header, Navbar, Footer)
        - Migrate Modal components
        - Migrate Page components
        - Migrate Card components
        - Migrate Chat components
        - Migrate Utility components
        - All the files
        - Remove ChakraProvider and dependencies

### SMTP

    - Improve the admin email CRM system to ensure robust email routing:
        - Use an appropriate subagent
        - Use the Supabase Foodshare MCP server
        - Include all 3 email operators
        - Explore the current implementation
        - Use the best bleeding edge practices
        - Use the latest packages compatible with the stack

### Supabase

    - Improve the Supabase auth system to ensure robust user authentication:
        - Use an appropriate subagent
        - Use the Supabase Foodshare MCP server
        - Include all 3 auth operators Resend, 
        - Explore the current implementation
        - Use the best bleeding edge practices
        - Use the latest packages compatible with the stack

    - Improve and optimize the existing Supabase edge functions:
        - Use the db if needed
        - Use MCP if needed
        - Use the best bleeding edge practices
        - Use the latest packages compatible with the stack
        - Heavily use caching
        - Don't create the redundancy
        - Upgrade edge functions to use modern patterns
        - Add a function description at the top of each function if it doesn't exist respectevely
        - Use edge function secrets
        - Check all the fucntions
        - Redeploy all edge fucntions with no JWT verification with no exception one by one:
            Verify JWT with legacy secret
            Requires that a JWT signed only by the legacy JWT secret is present in the Authorization header. The easy to obtain anon key can be used to satisfy this requirement. Recommendation: OFF with JWT and additional authorization logic implemented inside your function's code.

    - I'd like to check if a user doesn't exist in the db than we have to deffinetely create it and associate with the telegram id imidiately with the veryfication process and than if it posts or do something in terms of the data manipulation we just check it again. It would be very robast. If a user exists with an typed in email that is being verified it would accoicate a telegram user with an existing verified user via telegram:
        - Improve supabase/functions/telegram-bot-foodshare
        - Beautify the bot interface if we can
        - Don't document
        - We should offer to sign in with that email
        - If a user sign in successfuly than we accociate a telegram id with an signed in email via spabase veryfication process
        - If user doesn'e exist we let a user register with an email and then we accociate a telegram id with an signed in email via spabase veryfication process
        - It must be very user friendly
        - We don't need temporary accounts, just the regular email accounts
        - We must be able to verify it directly via Telegram
        - At the final stage deploy the edge function without the JWT verification
        - For an exiting account we don't need to recreate a profile just adding a telegram id
        - A new user creation is's only relevant if a user doesn't exist in the db
        - Add English, Russian, and German localization set up via button
        - Add back button
        - Add available post_arranged_at (timestamptz) field

    - > Authorized but don't see the proper drop down menu according to that witht the profile avatar, crm dasgboard etc:
        - Use 

### Localization

    - Improve the localization edge function for all of our cross-platform apps:
        - Use the db if needed
        - Use MCP if needed
        - Use the best bleeding edge practices
        - Use the latest packages compatible with the stack
        - Heavily use caching

    - Check the other existing edge fucntions:
        - Modify them to use the best practices bleeding edge features accordignly

### Refactoring

    - Refactor the codebase to use the best practices bleeding edge features accordingly
    - Refactor the codebase to use the latest packages compatible with the stack
    - Refactor the codebase to use the best practices for the layout, ui/ux etc
    - Refactor the codebase to use the best practices for the data flow
