## Draft Outreach Emails

### Email 1: Sacramento Mayor Kevin McCarty

**To:** mayor@cityofsacramento.org
**Subject:** Foodshare: A Sacramento-Built App to Fight Food Waste and Hunger

---

Dear Mayor McCarty,

Congratulations on your new role as Sacramento's mayor. I'm reaching out about **Foodshare**, a nonprofit mobile app built here in Sacramento that addresses two problems our city faces: food waste and food insecurity.

**The problem:** 40% of food in America goes to waste while 210,000 Sacramento residents face food insecurity. Our local food banks operate at capacity.

**Our solution:** Foodshare connects neighbors who have surplus food—home cooks with extra meals, restaurants with end-of-day items—to those who can use it. Think of it as a hyperlocal food-sharing network.

The app is production-ready and we're currently establishing our 501(c)(3) nonprofit status, with a planned launch in Sacramento in early 2026.

**Why we're reaching out:**
- Sacramento is our pilot city—we want to launch here first
- City partnership could accelerate adoption in food deserts and underserved neighborhoods
- Foodshare aligns with Sacramento's sustainability and community development goals
- We're seeking guidance on connecting with relevant city programs or departments

We'd welcome the opportunity for a brief conversation with your office or appropriate city staff about how Foodshare might support Sacramento's food security and waste reduction initiatives.

Thank you for your time and service to our community.

Respectfully,

**Tarlan Isaev**

### Email 2: Sacramento County Waste Management

**To:** CommercialWaste@SacCounty.gov
**Subject:** Partnership Inquiry: Foodshare App for Food Waste Diversion

---

Dear Sacramento County Waste Management Team,

I'm the founder of **Foodshare**, a Sacramento-based nonprofit mobile app designed to divert edible food from landfills by connecting people with surplus food to neighbors who can use it.

**How Foodshare supports SB 1383 goals:**
- Enables real-time redistribution of surplus food before it becomes waste
- Provides a free, accessible platform for residents and small businesses
- Tracks food diversion metrics for impact reporting
- Complements existing organic waste collection programs

Foodshare is production-ready and launching as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit in early 2026, with Sacramento as our pilot city.

**We're interested in exploring:**
- Whether Foodshare could be promoted as a resource for SB 1383 compliance
- Partnership opportunities with county food waste reduction initiatives
- Connecting with commercial food waste generators who could benefit
- Any grant programs supporting food diversion technology

I'd appreciate the opportunity to discuss how Foodshare might support the county's organic waste reduction efforts.

Thank you for your work keeping Sacramento sustainable.

Best regards,

### Email 3: Governor Gavin Newsom's Office

**To:** Submit via [gov.ca.gov/contact](https://www.gov.ca.gov/contact/)
**Subject:** Foodshare: California-Built Technology Fighting Food Waste

---

Dear Governor Newsom and Team,

I'm writing to share **Foodshare**, a nonprofit mobile app developed in Sacramento that directly supports California's leadership on climate action and food security.

**The California opportunity:**
- 6 million tons of food waste annually in California landfills
- Food waste is the single largest category in landfills, producing methane
- SB 1383 mandates 75% reduction in organic waste by 2025
- 1 in 8 Californians faces food insecurity

**Foodshare's solution:**
We've built a hyperlocal food-sharing platform that connects neighbors—home cooks, restaurants, grocery stores—to redistribute surplus food before it becomes waste. The app is production-ready, built with enterprise-grade security, and launching as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

**Our ask:**
- Guidance on California programs supporting food waste technology
- Connection to CalRecycle or CalOSBA resources for mission-driven startups
- Consideration for future California climate innovation initiatives

Sacramento is our pilot city. Our vision is statewide expansion, making California a model for community-driven food waste reduction.

Thank you for your administration's commitment to climate leadership.

Respectfully,

**Tarlan Isaev**
