**Subject:** Foodshare - Community Food Sharing Platform Supporting Climate & Food Security Goals

---

Hi there,

I hope this email finds you well! I recently received the update about the Regional Climate Collaboratives' Year 2 accomplishments, and I was really inspired by the work these collaboratives are doing across California. The focus on community-driven climate solutions and building resilience in under-resourced communities resonates deeply with what we're building.

I wanted to reach out to introduce **Foodshare** - a community food-sharing platform we're developing to tackle food waste and food insecurity simultaneously. We're creating a mobile app (iOS and web) that connects people who have surplus food with neighbors who need it, helping to keep perfectly good food out of landfills while strengthening community bonds.

**What we do:**

- Enable individuals, families, and small businesses to share surplus food with their local community
- Connect users with nearby food banks, community fridges, and zero-waste initiatives
- Facilitate real-time coordination for food pickup through location-based discovery and in-app messaging
- Track and measure food waste reduction impact (pounds diverted, CO2 emissions prevented)

**Why this matters for climate:**
Food waste is one of the largest contributors to methane emissions in landfills. By redirecting surplus food to people who need it, we're addressing both climate action and food security - two priorities I noticed are central to the RCC program's mission.

We're currently in active development with our iOS app and backend infrastructure, and we're exploring partnerships with community organizations, food banks, and local governments to pilot the platform in California communities.

**I'd love to explore:**

- Whether any of the current RCC collaboratives are working on food systems or waste reduction initiatives where Foodshare could be a helpful tool
- Opportunities to partner with collaboratives as a technical solution provider
- Future RCC funding cycles or other SGC programs that might align with our mission
- Ways we can support the collaboratives' community engagement and impact measurement goals

I know you're working with amazing partners across the state, and I'd be grateful for any guidance on how Foodshare might fit into this ecosystem. Would you be open to a brief call to discuss potential synergies?

Thank you for the incredible work you're doing to support community-led climate solutions across California. I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to this movement.

Warm regards,

**Subject:** Community Food Sharing Platform - Potential RCC Partnership

Hi SGC Team,

I was inspired by your recent update on the Regional Climate Collaboratives' Year 2 accomplishments! The community-driven approach to climate action really resonates with what we're building.

I'm reaching out to introduce **Foodshare** - a mobile platform that connects people with surplus food to neighbors who need it. We're tackling food waste (a major methane contributor) while building food security in local communities - right in line with RCC's mission.

Our platform enables:

- Peer-to-peer food sharing with location-based discovery
- Connections to food banks, community fridges, and zero-waste initiatives
- Real-time coordination and impact tracking

We're currently developing our iOS app and exploring partnerships with California communities. I'd love to learn more about:

- Whether current RCC collaboratives are working on food systems initiatives
- Future funding opportunities that might align with our mission
- Ways we could support collaboratives as a technical solution

Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential synergies?

Thanks for all you do to support community-led climate solutions!

Best,  
[Your Name]

## Tips for Sending

1. **Personalize it** - Add your name, title, and contact info
2. **Include metrics if you have them** - Any beta testing results, user feedback, or impact projections
3. **Attach a one-pager** - Consider creating a simple PDF overview of Foodshare with screenshots
4. **Follow up** - If no response in 2 weeks, send a friendly follow-up
5. **CC relevant people** - If you find specific collaborative contacts from the annual reports, consider reaching out to them directly too

## Next Steps After Sending

- Review the Year 2 Annual Reports for each collaborative (links in the original email)
- Identify 2-3 collaboratives that seem most aligned with food systems work
- Prepare a brief deck or one-pager about Foodshare for follow-up conversations
- Research other California climate/food security grant programs as backup options
