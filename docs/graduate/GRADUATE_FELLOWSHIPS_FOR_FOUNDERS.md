# Graduate Fellowships for FoodShare Founder/CEO

## Overview

This guide outlines graduate fellowship opportunities that could support you while pursuing a graduate degree alongside running FoodShare. These fellowships are designed for students enrolled in Masters or PhD programs in Computer Science and related fields.

## ⚠️ Critical Considerations

### Full-Time Enrollment Requirements

Most prestigious fellowships require **full-time enrollment** in graduate programs, which presents challenges for active startup founders:

- **NSF GRFP**: Requires full-time enrollment; limits outside work to **10 hours/week during academic year** and 20 hours/week in summer
- **GEM Fellowship**: Requires full-time enrollment plus mandatory summer internships with corporate sponsors
- **Hertz Fellowship**: Requires full-time PhD enrollment (up to 5 years of funding)

### Key Question

**Can you commit to full-time graduate study while running FoodShare?** This typically means:

- 40+ hours/week on coursework and research
- Limited time for startup operations (10-20 hours/week max)
- Potentially delegating CEO responsibilities or bringing in a co-founder/COO

   - Designed for working professionals
   - Weekend or evening classes
   - Often self-funded (no fellowship support)

3. **Online Graduate Programs**
   - Georgia Tech OMSCS (Online MS in Computer Science)
   - Stanford online programs
   - More flexibility but limited fellowship opportunities

### Entrepreneurship-Focused Programs

Consider programs specifically designed for student entrepreneurs:

1. **Rice Innovation Fellows**
